# BMR algorithm
This directory contains an Algorun container implementing the BMR algorithm for minimal hitting set enumeration.
For details of the algorithm, see [_A fast algorithm for computing hypergraph transversals and its application in mining emerging patterns_](//doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2003.1250958).

## Implementation
The implementation provided in [src/alg](src/alg) is C code written by and copyright of Keisuke Murakami and distributed at the [Hypergraph Dualization Repository](//research.nii.ac.jp/~uno/dualization.html).
It is redistributed here by permission from the authors; see [src/alg/LICENSE.md](src/alg/LICENSE.md) for details.
