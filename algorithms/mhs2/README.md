# MHS2
This directory contains an Algorun container implementing the MHSÂ² algorithm for minimal hitting set enumeration.
For details of the algorithm, see
Implementation of the [MHS2](https://github.com/npcardoso/MHS2) parallel approximating MHS algorithm.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in [src/alg](src/alg) is C++ code written by Nunu Cardoso and distributed at the project's [Github repository](//github.com/npcardoso/MHS2).
It is distributed here without modification under the terms of the GPL3; see the [README](src/alg/README.md) for details.
