# DL algorithm
This directory contains an Algorun container implementing the DL algorithm for minimal hitting set enumeration.
For details of the algorithm, see [_Mining border descriptions of emerging patterns from dataset pairs_](//doi.org/10.1007/s10115-004-0178-1) by Dong and Li.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in [src/alg](src/alg) is C code written by Keisuke Murakami and distributed at the [Hypergraph Dualization Repository](//research.nii.ac.jp/~uno/dualization.html).
