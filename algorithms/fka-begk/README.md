# FK algorithm
This directory contains an Algorun container implementing the FK-A algorithm for minimal hitting set enumeration.
For details of the algorithm, see [_On the complexity of dualization of monotone disjunctive normal forms_](//doi.org/10.1006/jagm.1996.0062) by Fredman and Khachiyan and [_An efficient implementation of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for generating hypergraph transversals and its application in joint generation_](//doi.org/10.1016/j.dam.2006.04.012) by Khachiyan et al.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in [src/alg](src/alg) is compiled from C code written by K. Elbassioni and distributed at the website of [Endre Boros](//rutcor.rutgers.edu/~boros/IDM/DualizationCode.html).
It is included here by permission of the author and is provided as-is and without warranty.
