# KS algorithm
This directory contains an Algorun container implementing the KS algorithm for minimal hitting set enumeration.
For details of the algorithm, see [_An efficient algorithm for the transversal hypergraph generation_](//doi.org/10.7155/jgaa.00107) by Kavvadias and Stavropoulos.

## Implementation
The implementation provided in [src/alg](src/alg) is compiled from Pascal code written by Stavropoulos and distributed at the [Hypergraph Dualization Repository](//research.nii.ac.jp/~uno/dualization.html).
